### Proposal:
Athletes are constantly exerting their bodies to perform at the highest level, but through this constant strain on the body, they are prone to injuries. Athletes need a reliable way to be more informed about potential and current injuries they have or will have. Our target population includes athletes involved in club/professional/recreational sports. We want to particularly focus on athletes that prone to injuries or are currently injured so they can rely on an informative source to help guide them to better health. Our app will allow the user to track past and current injuries (showing progress and status of injury to recovery), provide information about various injuries/strains and remedies to help recovery fully, and show potential doctors and health stores nearby. Possible sources of real-world data or APIs that we will be using are Google Maps, Yelp, and sports data sets (NBA, NFL, MLB, etc). This app fits the project theme because none of our team members are athletes on the professional or competitive level.
