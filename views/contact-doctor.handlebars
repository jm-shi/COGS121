    The contact page is what users will use to send emails to their doctors for use.
    The user can enter which doctor to send to, the subject of the message, and the message itself.
    Within the message, the user's entire injury log is attached.

    As of the deadline for the final, the email function does not work as it did originally.
    We originally used a service called PostMail, but it has recently stopped working.
    So we have wizard of oz'd the function. For us, making it functional in the beginning was of somewhat low priority.
