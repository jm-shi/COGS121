### How our idea is similar and/or different from our proposed idea:

> Our idea has not changed from what we proposed. The only major difference in our app idea is to have more emphasis on being able to communicate injuries and problems through an injury log sent directly to the doctor.
> Our app will still include self-diagnosis and remedies, but through non-prescriptionalized means. As an additional function, our app will still have the ability to locate doctors and stores.

### How our screenshots are similiar and/or different from our paper prototypes:

> Our screenshots communicate our decision to take the better screens of the 2 paper prototypes to make our app. From prototype 1, we kept the home screen and the injury list design.
> From prototype 2, we kept the injury logs format of having two separate screens, one for current injuries and one for past injuries that can be accessed through tabs. In addition to this, we also kept the combined map format
> that contains both doctors and stores instead of separate maps. The newest thing we chose to include is a screen dedicated to sending a message and injury log to the doctor of the user's choice instead of from the injury information page.
