### Improvements made since milestone 3
One of the more noticeable changes we made since milestone 3 was that we added markers corresponding to each doctor/pharmacy to the map. Users can use the searchbar to find doctors/pharmacies close to a specified location, and the markers will update dynamically. We also cleaned up the way the time was displayed for injury logs: rather than display something overly complex like "Mon May 13 2019 09:46:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)," times would be shown in a simplified format such as "Mon May 13 2019." In addition, we implemented an injury history feature so that users can log their progress for each of their injuries over time. We made slight adjustments to our login and profile screen in terms of padding/borders, and added an overview of each sport in the list of popular sports. Lastly, for the "Contact Doctor" page, the information is now sent in the form of an email, instead of being non-functional.

### User action 1
Suppose you sprained your ankle while playing soccer. Go to your injury logs, and create a new injury titled, "Ankle sprain." Set the expected recovery date to be one week from now. (This will create a new row for the injury table in the PostgreSQL database, that can also be updated/deleted as desired.)

### User action 2
On the map screen, use the searchbar to find nearby doctors and pharmacies in San Francisco. Click a marker on the map and view more details about that particular doctor/pharmacy.
