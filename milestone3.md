### UI improvements since milestone 2:

> One of the improvements we made since milestone 2 was make our app more responsive so that it is easily readable on any screen size, mobile or desktop. We also added icons to the buttons on the home page, and replaced our placeholder images for sports/injuries with actual images that were retrieved from our database (PostgreSQL). Overall, our screens look cleaner as we repositioned items so that they weren't located in awkward positions. 

### Database
> We used PostgreSQL to store out data, which included the static files that pertain to common injuries associated with specific sports, as well as user-generated content such as the injury logs they create. We decided to use PostgreSQL as our database for several reasons. For one thing, it was a great opportunity to learn more about the SQL language. Second, we used Heroku to deploy our app, and Heroku has high compatability with Postgres. (If we went with SQLite or MySQL, we would have had to migrate to Postgres eventually in order to have our app deployed on Heroku.) Third, using Postgres allowed us to work on local databases, so if we accidentally made a mess to our server, our database on Heroku would be unaffected.
