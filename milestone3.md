### How UI skeleton has improved compared to milestone2:

> Our UI skeleton has improved because of the new icons and changes in the overall design of the pages. For example,
for our Injury List and Common Injuries page, we removed the filter button and added a search bar instead as a filter
button did not make much sense to have. Also, our other pages show a change in the overall design such as the box layouts
changing.
